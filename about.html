									<h1>Know More<br />
									About Me</h1>
									<p>I am an aspiring Data Analyst with a passion for lifelong learning. My expertise lies in Excel, MySQL and Power BI which I used to turn raw data into meaningful insights.
									   I always keep exploring new career fields and opportunities, and looking for ways to challenge myself and reach new heights.<br />
									When I'm not diving into the latest finance and business books, you can find me expanding my knowledge on investing, and looking for opportunities to connect with industry experts in the future.

								<p>After failing Engineering Entrance Exams after class 12, I had two choices: either take a drop and prepare for the whole year or take admission in a private college. But I didn't have money for even a semester, so technically, I only had one choice. However, I opted for a third option (don't get confused, I didn't mention the third option earlier, lol). I took a drop and did nothing for complete 8 months. Then, in April 2022, I joined the Online BS Degree Programme started by IIT Madras. That was a big "Aha!" moment for me. Now I will have a degree â€“ congratulations to me! From that point onwards, I became a goal-oriented person with full enthusiasm. I explored various domains in tech like Web Development, Backend Development, Data Science, and Data Analytics. I moved forward with Data-driven skills (DS and DA), and even my college degree is in this domain. This gave me a major push to choose Data Analytics over other tech domains. Fast forward to today, I am more focused on making projects to showcase my expertise, diving deep, and learning advanced concepts. So this is my story. Although I have not done anything big yet that makes this an inspirational story, I am doing great each and every day, slowly and steadily.</p>
